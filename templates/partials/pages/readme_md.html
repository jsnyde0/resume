      <li>
        I'm prone to overthinking, but a quick "just do it" snaps me out of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        I try to resist shiny new tech, sticking to <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" class="link">boring technology</a> until key moments.
      </li>
      <li>
        I keep a running commentary to be more <a href="https://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/" target="_blank" class="link">interruptible</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I struggle with being overruled when something feels like it's my responsibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        I fundamentally assume everyone's doing their best, even when it doesn't seem that way.
      </li>
      <li>
        I try to consider social imbalances and my own privilege, that I probably don't fully grasp.
      </li>
      <li>
        I get restless in my comfort zone - I enjoy pushing boundaries and learning about myself.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <c-resume-card title="What I Value">
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        Directness, especially when it's tough to say or hear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learning to set boundaries when you've been raised to please.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transparency that fosters connection and inclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Owning your work, responsibilities, and mistakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Honestly considering feedback before reacting defensively.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asynchronous communication over constant meetings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Autonomously tracking work, even when you can't act on it right away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allowing non-critical mistakes to foster ownership.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pointing out my blind spots, including those tied to privilege.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <c-resume-card title="How you can help me">
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        Tell me to "just do it" when I'm stuck in perfectionism - that's usually all it takes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give feedback, don't jump in - I want to maintain my sense of ownership.
      </li>
      <li>
        Own your tasks; managing others' work drains me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meet with clear agendas so we use time well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remind me I can ask for help - I tend to tackle everything solo.
      </li>
